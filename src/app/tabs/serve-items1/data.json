  "description": "Prenatal Massage is not just about reducing pain, pressure, and discomfort. It can also serve to increase the health of mom and baby and even improve the labor and birth.<br />  Pregnancy (and caring for your baby after the birth) changes your center of gravity and puts a lot of stress on your back, neck, abdominal muscles, and shoulders. In addition, hormones loosen your ligaments, making your pelvic joints less stable, changing your posture, and pulling your pelvis forward. Add to that the extra weight youâ€™re carrying and it is no wonder you may have a lot of discomforts and difficulty sleeping."
